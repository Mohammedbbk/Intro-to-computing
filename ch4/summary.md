### A higher-order procedure is a procedure that takes other procedures as in- puts or that produces a procedure as its output. Higher-order procedures give us the ability to write procedures that behave differently based on the procedures that are passed in as inputs.

## How to debug 
The process of fixing broken programs is known as debugging. The key to de-
bugging effectively is to be systematic and thoughtful. It is a good idea to take
notes to keep track of what you have learned and what you have tried. Thought-
less debugging can be very frustrating, and is unlikely to lead to a correct pro-
gram.
A good strategy for debugging is to:
1. Ensure you understand the intended behavior of your procedure. Think of
a few representative inputs, and what the expected output should be.
2. Do experiments to observe the actual behavior of your procedure. Try your
program on simple inputs first. What is the relationship between the ac-
tual outputs and the desired outputs? Does it work correctly for some in-
puts but not others?
3. Make changes to your procedure and retest it. If you are not sure what to
do, make changes in small steps and carefully observe the impact of each
change.
For more complex programs, follow this strategy at the level of sub-components.
For example, you can try debugging at the level of one expression before trying
the whole procedure. Break your program into several procedures so you can
test and debug each procedure independently. The smaller the unit you test at
one time, the easier it is to understand and fix problems.
